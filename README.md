# <p align="center">🏝️ Far Away Travel 💼</p>

## Overview 📃
Far away travel is the first React app that I have made. It is a very simple and basic checklist app. I have built this app to understand React properties like
+ **What is JSX**
+ **How to read data(Array/Object) in REACT**
+ **Uses of props**
+ **when to use State**
+ **how to use controlled items**<br>


Overall I got to learn that to make any REACT app we have to first break the app in small reusable components and put them together at the end to make the complete app.
